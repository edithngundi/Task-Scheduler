    "## A day in the life of a Minervan—Part I\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a Location-Based Assignment (LBA), in which you will build an automatic activity scheduler for a\n",
    "day in the life of a Minervan in your current rotation city based on a priority queue. You will create a list\n",
    "of activities, each with its own duration and task dependencies, that you would plan to do in a day in\n",
    "your rotation city.\n",
    "Important notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "● Given the Covid-19 pandemic, please rigorously follow all the local guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "● Please be aware of the weight of this assignment in relation to others, which should reflect both\n",
    "time and effort management. Please plan accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "● Please refer to the CS110 course guide on how to submit your assignment materials (specifically\n",
    "how many HCs you should tag) and produce a well-presented report. You will receive an overall\n",
    "grade on #professionalism.\n",
    "\n",
    "### An overview\n",
    "Revisiting the activity scheduler from the “Heaps and priority queues” lesson—Your activity scheduler\n",
    "receives a list of tasks to be performed in a day, with the following schema:\n",
    "\n",
    "● id: a unique task identifier (that can be referenced by other tasks).\n",
    "\n",
    "● description: a short description of the task (e.g. ‘visit the Neues Museum’, ‘dine gogigui’, ‘get a\n",
    "Fahrkarten’, ‘go to an exhibition at the Dongdaemun Design Plaza”, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "● duration: in minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "● dependencies: list of id’s indicating whether the current task cannot begin until all of its dependencies\n",
    "have been completed (e.g. one cannot eat gogigui unless one has already found a restaurant in Seoul, has\n",
    "arrived at a restaurant, has gotten a table, has ordered, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "● status: the state of a task; possible values are not_yet_started, in_progress, or completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scheduler will use a priority queue as the primary data structure to plan the execution of the tasks.\n",
    "Please note that for this assignment, you are expected to write your own max- or min-heap\n",
    "implementation (rather than using the heapq module).\n",
    "\n",
    "The scheduler must keep a clock, expressed in units of minutes, that gets incremented by a fixed\n",
    "time-step (an interval in time). Your scheduler needs to output a step-by-step execution of the input\n",
    "tasks as well as a report on the total amount of time required to execute all the tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How will your implementation differ from the one discussed in class?\n",
    "\n",
    "1)You will need to assign a priority value to each task (in class, we assumed that every task was\n",
    "equally important).\n",
    "\n",
    "2)We will now allow for multitasking (i.e., two or more tasks might be executed at the same time).\n",
    "\n",
    "Criteria for scheduling activities—Your program will begin scheduling tasks by looking at which tasks are\n",
    "ready to be executed. Unlike in the example in class, tasks will now, as a point of principle, have a\n",
    "different priority. There are at least two aspects that might change the notion of priority of a task:\n",
    "\n",
    "● some tasks might have specific constraints that enforce a certain priority over others (for\n",
    "example, the CS110 class happens at a specific time of day which you can’t change).\n",
    "\n",
    "● the number of dependencies of a given task can also be used as a proxy for priority. For example,\n",
    "a task with no dependencies may be considered to have more priority than one that only\n",
    "happens following other tasks. On the other hand, you may choose to consider first a task that\n",
    "has a large number of dependencies. Either way, you need to be clear about the choices you are\n",
    "making as you describe your approach, or, even more specifically, as you apply\n",
    "#AlgorithmicStrategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tasks priority value—It’s your choice to define the priority criterion for the situations described above;\n",
    "you will just need to explicitly identify it and justify why it’s a sensible choice. This is an important\n",
    "improvement to the code we have discussed in the “Heaps and priority queues” lesson, and it needs to\n",
    "be very clearly explained both in the main text and in the main code.\n",

    "### Q1\n",
    "#### A. Prepare a table containing all the activities that you plan to do in the city of your rotation, with a short, compelling justification of why they are interesting. The table needs to include:\n",
    "##### At least 5 activities, each of which can be subdivided into 3 to k sub-tasks.For example, if you need to go grocery shopping, you may need to collect bags from your room to bring the shopping, leave the residence, and take a bus to the shopping location.\n",
    "##### At least 3 culturally specific to your rotation city (not routine nor academic). Please refer to the Student Life City Experiences guide for a list of activities that are recommended for each city.\n",
    "I have chosen these activities because they explore the social issues of San Francisco. The city has a vibrant art scene, especially street art and murals. Balmy Alley is a great place to explore the city's art scene. In addition, over the past decade gentrificication has been on the rise because of the emergence of tech companies. The Mission District has been gentrified significantly, and I believe its a great place to learn about the impacts of gentrification. In addition, the Mission has a rich Latinx community that I'd want to immerse myself in. Lastly, volunteering is the best way to be involved in the community so I'd want to participate in such programs with a local church.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have described 5 major activities and saved each subtask with an alphanumeric task ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) CULTURALLY SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES:\n",
    "- Exploring to Balmy Alley with substasks BAL/01, BAL/02, and BAL/03\n",
    "- Exploring the Mission District with substasks MIS/01, MIS/02, MIS/03, MIS/04, and MIS/05\n",
    "- Volunteering at Epic Church with subtasks EPI/01, EPI/02, EPI/03, and EPI/04\n",
    "\n",
    "2) OTHER ACTIVITIES:\n",
    "- Schoolwork with Rebeca with subtasks SCH/01, SCH/02, SCH/03, and SCH/04\n",
    "- Work-study with subtasks WRK/01, WRK/02, and WRK/03\n",
    "\n",
    "#### B. How will you store information about these activities and sub-tasks?\n",
    "I created a csv file for my activities with the headings TASK ID, DESCRIPTION, DEPENDENCIES, DURATION, STATUS and PRIORITY VALUE. The subtasks of a particular activity have the same uppercase letters in the task id. The dependencies are stores as list and for activities that don't have dependencies, I filled in an empty list. Initially the priority values are 0 but they will later be updated inline with some conditional statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### C. Describe how your scheduler will work, with an emphasis on why a priority queue is a well-suited data structure to handle the prioritization of tasks, and how you have defined and computed the priority value of each task and/or sub-task. Explain your answers as clearly as you can.\n",
    "\n",
    "The justifications of the priority values is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) ASSIGNING PRIORITY VALUES DEPENDING ON TASK ID\n",
    "If a task is dependent on someone else's time it is more urgent. However, there is also greater urgency if the task has a deadline.\n",
    "Therefore:\n",
    "- Set the starting priority value of the tasks WRK/02, SCH/01, SCH/02, SCH/03 and SCH/04 to 400 because they are dependent on someone else's time. These are activities that involve Rebeca and the work-study manager.\n",
    "- Set the starting priority value of the tasks WRK/01, WRK/02 and WRK/03 to 500 because they have deadlines.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) ASSIGNING PRIORITY VALUES DEPENDING ON DURATION\n",
    "If a task is takes a short amount of time it is more urgent.\n",
    "Therefore:\n",
    "- If the activity takes less than 20 minutes, 100 is added to its current priority value.\n",
    "- If the activity takes between 20 minutes and 50 minutes, 50 is added to its current priority value.\n",
    "- If the activity takes more than 50 minutes, 25 is added to its current priority value.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) ASSIGNING PRIORITY VALUES DEPENDING ON WHETHER THE TASK HAS DEPENDENCIES OR NOT\n",
    "If a task has no dependencies it is given a higher priority because it can be completed easily.\n",
    "If a task is a dependency for another activity, it is given more priority so that it can be completed first.\n",
    "Therefore:\n",
    "- If a task has no dependencies, 100 is added to its current priority value\n",
    "- If a task is a dependency to another activity, 50 is added to its current priority value\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of my scheduler is through a priority queue in the form of a maxheap, where the activity with the greatest priority value gets executed first. The greatest priority value will be the root node of the heap and all the successive priority values find their appropriate position in the heap according to the maxheap property. In this implementation, if two elements have the same priority, they are served according to the order in which they were enqueued."

    "### Q3\n",
    "#### Now, you realize that some of the tasks in your schedule can be multi-tasked! In other words, many of your daily tasks can be performed simultaneously (e.g. sipping a local beverage while chatting with a friend at a cafe, taking pictures while riding a bus, or walking in a park). You will modify your algorithmic approach to now handle multi-tasks. Notice that while some tasks can be multi-tasked, others may demand your full attention (e.g. CS110 pre-class work).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Your input for each activity now includes an extra feature:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ● multi_tasking: boolean field for whether a task can be multitasked.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Criteria for scheduling non-multi-tasking activities—For tasks that require your full attention, your program cannot schedule any other tasks while that task’s status is in_progress. Note that if such a task (say A) is part of the dependencies of another task (say B), then once A’s status is set to completed, you will be required to update that property on the dependencies of B and the corresponding priorities.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Criteria for scheduling Multitasking tasks—For tasks that can be done at the same time, they may have a different duration and terminate at different times. As such, you will need to keep track of the remaining time for every task being processed in multi-tasking mode and update the scheduler clock accordingly. In fact, when two or more multi-tasking activities are being executed, the remaining time of every activity needs to be adjusted at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notice that multi-tasking activities can but need not be executed at the same time. For example, ‘eat a delicious pizza’ and ‘brushing your teeth’ don’t make sense together, but you can ‘eat a pizza’ while ‘talking to a friend’, and you can ‘brush your teeth’ while ‘listening to a podcast.’ How do you include these constraints in your schedule? Your response to the points below needs to address this.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A. Describe as clearly as you can any changes you will need to make to the first version of the scheduler to include multi-tasking activities.\n",
    "- MULTI-TASKING is a new variable/attribute to the dataframe. It is a boolean that is expressed as either True (if the activity can be multi-tasked) or False (if the activity cannot be multi-tasked).\n",
    "\n",
    "- MULTI-TASKING is added into the priority_value_assignment function. Because when multitasking several items are worked on concurrently, then it means more tasks get checked off from the scheduler when completed. Therefore, tasks that can be multi-tasked are given a higher priority value- 1000 is added to the current priority value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- multitasking will be added as one of the attributes of the class instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### B. Describe how constraints in the scheduling process are handled by a priority queue.\n",
    "- The first constraint for scheduling non-multitasking activities does not apply to my list of activities because none of the tasks' status says in_progress. Therefore, if I had a task A that is completed and is a dependency to another task B, I do not need to update the priority values of B's dependencies because all my tasks' status say not_yet_started. However, inorder to make the code more reliable for different kinds of inputs (that is, status inputs other than not_yet_started) I believe I can implement this using the code in the code cell below.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The second constraint applies to my list of activities given that my scheduler allows for multi-tasking. The activities that allow for multi-tasking might have different durations of execution, therefore whenever they are getting executed, the scheduler will take into account the longest duration. That way we will ensure that both the short tasks and long tasks that are multi-tasked are carried out during the same timeframe, before the scheduler moves on other activities."

    "#### It’s time to take your data scheduler for a spin! Use it to plan your day considering the constraints highlighted in the assignment. Use this as an opportunity to efficiently plan a day where you explore your city of rotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### You should aim for a 150-500 word summary (at least 10 lines), that is both well-written and critical. Include as many details as you deem necessary for your analysis.##\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A. Produce a critical analysis of your scheduler, including pictures you take for this test drive highlighting:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ● all the benefits in following the algorithmic directives defined in the instructions (rather than deciding on the spot where to go next!)\n",
    "The algorithmic directives are decision making tools that take into account all the variables that would make one activity a priority over another. Intuitively, these are the variables we think about when creating a schedule without any tools. The benefit of the algorithm is that it is a formal approach that calculates the priority value depending on the variables you are considering which makes it dependable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ● and any failure modes and/or limitations you envision it running into.\n",
    "The implementation of multi-tasking feels very wishful and ablelist. An improvement of this would be finding a way of grouping fewer multi-tasking activities based on their descriptions. If a schedule has 6 multi-tasking activities, even if they can all happen simultaneously, not everyone can manage to do this. The improvement would be to break them down, or maybe set times when each group of multi-tasking activities could take place.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### B. Examine the efficiency of your schedule (not the scheduler) and include any explicit reference to the metrics you employed to determine this.\n",
    "##### Needs more inputs/variables/attributes to be make the priority_value_assignment function more effective.\n",
    "At first glance, it is easy to build a rationale on how to weight the urgency of a task from looking at the dependencies and the duration. However, this is not enough information. I think more variables/attributes are needed like checking whether a task has a deadline, checking whether a task involves another participant, etc. This makes it easier to write a more reliable priority_assignment function. In my code, I ended up writing out one by one the tasks that had deadlines and the tasks that involved participants when assigning priority values based on task id. This could have been implemented better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, I ended up having so many priority value duplicates. I think this can be offsetted by having more attributes. With more attributes getting considered in the priority_assignment, it is easier to get different values of the priority value.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### It is unrealistic\n",
    "In several instances, the activities don't follow each other organically. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "⏰Simple Scheduler at time 8h00 started executing task EPI/01 that takes 15 mins\n",
    "✅ Completed Task EPI/01 - 'Walk to Epic Church with fellow Minervans' at time 8h00\n",
    "\n",
    "⏰Simple Scheduler at time 8h00 started executing task BAL/02 that takes 10 mins\n",
    "✅ Completed Task BAL/02 - 'Take the bart to 16th and Mission' at time 8h00\n",
    "\n",
    "⏰Simple Scheduler at time 8h15 started executing task WRK/02 that takes 90 mins\n",
    "✅ Completed Task WRK/02 - 'Attend meeting and collaborate on work assignment' at time 8h15\n",
    "\n",
    "This ties back to considering more variables for the priority_value_assignment function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### C. Will you start using your algorithm to schedule your day? Explain your answer in as much detail as possible.\n",
    "The algorithm at the moment is inefficient in scheduling activities, and for it to be more effective it requires the consideration of more variables. Finding this data is tedious. Comparing between creating a csv file and inputing all the variables for all the activities, and using simple heuristics to come up with a simple to do list, the latter is a less tedious experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, if the algorithm was made more efficient, then it would serve a greater purpose if it was used to schedule a lot of tasks. Using such an expensive method to schedule a day (on average about 5 major tasks) feels like a waste of resources."

    "I have performed a critical analysis of the priority_value_assignment function with an emphasis on its variables. I have indicated that the dataframe provided has very few inderpendent variables which makes it difficult coming up with more diverse priority values (deependent variable). I suggest an improvement to the current function- include more boolean viariables, such as, whether a task involves other people, whether a task has a deadline, etc. \n",

    "#### algorithms:\n",
    "I have accurately implemented a task scheduler that uses the maxheap property and considers the priority values as elements of the heap. In my implementation, I have treated tasks as objects and accurately executed the class functions. Though the mechanism could have been improved, the overall algorithm does a comparatively good job in creating a schedule.\n",

    "#### constraints:\n",
    "I have accurately applied constraint satisfaction in the multi-tasking algorithm by ensuring that the scheduler takes uses the longest duration when scheduling the tasks that can be multi-tasked. I have also offered a possible solution for the first constraint by suggesting an algorithm that could update the priority value of tasks that are dependencies of another non-multi-tasking activity."
